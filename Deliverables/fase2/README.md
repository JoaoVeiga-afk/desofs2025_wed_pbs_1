# Fase 2


This phase focuses on defining and enforcing development standards across the repository.  
To ensure consistency, collaboration, and code quality, we have structured our guidelines and automation into two main areas:

---

## 📄 Repository Contribution Rules

This section outlines the standards all contributors must follow when working in this repository:

- **Branch Naming** – Structured names based on feature type and issue ID
- **Commit Messages** – Clear, consistent messages with type and reference
- **Pull Requests** – Guidelines for creating and reviewing PRs

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipelines
We use GitHub Actions to automate our development lifecycle, ensuring each change is properly verified.

This section documents:
- Linting and formatting steps
- Build process
- SonarQube analysis
- Unit test execution
- Workflow orchestration
